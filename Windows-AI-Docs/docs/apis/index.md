# What are Windows AI APIs?

:::image type="content" source="../images/ai-api-header.png" border="false" alt-text="Image showing the icons for various Windows AI APIs.":::

A variety of artificial intelligence (AI) features are supported by a suite of hardware-abstracted AI APIs powered by [Windows Machine Learning (ML)](../new-windows-ml/overview.md). The Windows AI APIs enable AI capabilities without the need to find, run, or optimize your own machine learning (ML) model. The models that power the Windows AI APIs on Copilot+ PCs run locally and can run continuously in the background.

See the [Windows AI APIs with WinUI sample app](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/experimental/Samples/WindowsAIFoundry/cs-winui) for how to use Microsoft Foundry on Windows with WinUI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following is a list of Windows AI features and the Windows App SDK release in which they are currently supported. See [Overview of available APIs](#overview-of-available-apis) later in this topic for brief descriptions.

## Build your first AI-powered Windows app

> [!TIP]
> To improve accessibility and readability, this page displays still images by default. In some cases, you can click an image to see an animated version.

To build your first Windows app with Visual Studio and some simple Windows AI APIs, just meet the prerequisites and use the provided example code in [Get started building an app with Windows AI APIs](./get-started.md).

From there, you can jump into short tutorials that build an app leveraging specific Windows AI APIs such as the [Phi Silica walthrough](./phi-silica-tutorial.md), [Imaging walthrough](./imaging-tutorial.md) and [OCR walthrough](./text-recognition-tutorial.md).

## Try the APIs and models on your PC

AI Dev Gallery is a demo app&mdash;available from the Microsoft Store&mdash;that lets you quickly download, try out, and use Windows AI APIs and models.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Install AI Dev Gallery from the Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9N9PN1MM3BD5)

In AI Dev Gallery, select the **Windows AI APIs tab** menu item, then select the *Phi Silica* sample. If the model is already available on your device, then that sample will run straight away. Otherwise, select **Request model** to download the model. Once downloaded, that sample will be activated. Learn more about the AI Dev Gallery in [What is the AI Dev Gallery?](../ai-dev-gallery/index.md).

## Overview of available APIs

Here are a few ready-to-use AI features that you can tap into from your Windows app:

### Phi Silica

Similar to OpenAI's GPT Large Language Model (LLM), which powers ChatGPT, Phi Silica is a Small Language Model (SLM) developed by Microsoft Research to perform language-processing tasks on a local device (see [Get started with Phi Silica](./phi-silica.md)). Phi Silica is specifically designed for Windows devices that have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), allowing text generation and conversation features to run in a high performance, hardware-accelerated way directly on the device. *Phi Silica is not available in China.*

> [Try it in AI Dev Gallery](aidevgallery://apis/9b56e116-c142-4be1-827c-cb023743aca2?src=docs)

### Text recognition

The text recognition APIs enable the recognition of text in an image, and the conversion on a local device of different types of documents (such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, and images captured by a digital camera) into editable and searchable data (see [Get started with AI text recognition](./text-recognition.md)).

### Imaging

Scale and sharpen images (Image Super Resolution), identify objects within an image (Image Segmentation), generate natural-language descriptions of images (Image Description), and remove objects from images (Object Erase). See [Get Started with AI imaging](./imaging.md).

#### Image Super Resolution

The Image Super Resolution APIs enable image sharpening and scaling.

:::image type="content" source="../images/waif-superres.png" lightbox="../images/waif-superres.gif" alt-text="An animated gif showing an image with a mix of words and pictures that is being sharpened and scaled using the Image Super Resolution feature.":::

> [Try it in AI Dev Gallery](aidevgallery://apis/97ed0b95-3f14-415c-bb1f-9a6c59b78c3d?src=docs)

Also see [What can I do with Image Super Resolution?](imaging.md#what-can-i-do-with-image-super-resolution).

#### Image Segmentation

The Image Segmentation APIs enable segmentation of images.

#### Image Description

The Image Description APIs describes images in natural language.

> [!NOTE]
> Image Description features are not available in China.

Also see [What can I do with Image Description?](imaging.md#what-can-i-do-with-image-description)

#### Object Erase

The Object Erase APIs allows for removing objects from images.

Also see [Get started with Object Erase](../apis/imaging.md#what-can-i-do-with-object-erase)

### Additional AI features

- **Live Caption Translations (Not yet supported)**. Help everyone using Windows&mdash;including those who are deaf or hard of hearing&mdash;better understand audio by viewing captions of spoken content (even when the audio content is in a language that's different from the system's preferred language).

## Content moderation

Learn how content is moderated by the Windows AI APIs, and how you can adjust sensitivity filters. See [Content safety moderation with the Windows AI APIs](content-moderation.md).

When utilizing AI features, we recommend that you review: [Developing Responsible Generative AI Applications and Features on Windows](../rai.md).
