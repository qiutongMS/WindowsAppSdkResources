# AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation has moved. For the latest cross-platform guidance, see [AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/intelligentapps/overview).

The AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code is a VS Code extension that helps developers build generative AI applications locally. It provides access to AI models from the [Microsoft Foundry catalog](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models), and additional catalogs. It also offers tools for downloading, fine-tuning, and deploying models on your local machine or NPU-enabled devices.

> [!TIP]
> The **Deepseek R1 Distilled** model is optimized for the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and available to download on Snapdragon powered Copilot+ PCs running Windows 11. For more information, see [Running Distilled DeepSeek R1 models locally on Copilot+ PCs, powered by Windows AI Foundry](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/01/29/running-distilled-deepseek-r1-models-locally-on-copilot-pcs-powered-by-windows-copilot-runtime/).
