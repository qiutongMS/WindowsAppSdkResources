# What is the AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code?

The AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a VS Code extension that simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from the [Azure AI Foundry catalog](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview) and other catalogs like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).

> [!NOTE]
> Additional documentation and tutorials for the AI Toolkit for VS Code are available in the VS Code documentation: [AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/intelligentapps/overview). You'll find guidance on Playground, working with AI models, fine-tuning local and cloud-based models, and more.

## AI Toolkit features

The AI Toolkit for VS Code (AI Toolkit) enables you to:

- Download and run AI models locally. The AI Toolkit provides access to highly optimized models for the following platforms and hardware:
  - Windows 11 running with DirectML acceleration
  - Windows 11 running directly on the CPU
  - Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs running on the NPU
  - Linux with NVIDIA acceleration
  - Linux running directly on the CPU
  - *MacOS support is coming soon*
- Test models in an intuitive playground or in your application with a REST API.
- Fine-tune your AI model - locally or in the cloud (on a virtual machine) - to create new skills, improve reliability of responses, set the tone and format of the response. The AI Toolkit provides a guided walkthrough to fine-tune popular small-language models (SLMs) - like [Phi-3](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-phi-3-redefining-whats-possible-with-slms/) and [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/).
- Deploy your AI feature either to the cloud or with an application that runs on a device.
- [Batch run prompts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/intelligentapps/bulkrun) for selected AI models in the Playground.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Deepseek R1 Distilled* model is optimized for the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and available to download on Snapdragon powered Copilot+ PCs running Windows 11. For more information, see [Running Distilled DeepSeek R1 models locally on Copilot+ PCs, powered by Windows AI Foundry](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/01/29/running-distilled-deepseek-r1-models-locally-on-copilot-pcs-powered-by-windows-copilot-runtime/).
>
> The AI Toolkit now supports a [Bring Your Own Model](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredevcommunityblog/bring-your-own-models-on-ai-toolkit---using-ollama-and-api-keys/4369411) approach. You can use the AI Toolkit to download your own models, such as [DeepSeek-R1](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1), from catalogs like Ollama and run them locally.
