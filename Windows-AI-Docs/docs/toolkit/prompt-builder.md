# Get started with Prompt Builder in AI Toolkit for VS Code

The AI Toolkit for VS Code (AI Toolkit) is a VS Code extension that enables you to download, test, fine-tune, and deploy AI models with your apps or in the cloud. For more information, see the [AI Toolkit overview](index.md).

One of the key features of the AI Toolkit is the **Prompt Builder**. The Prompt Builder is a tool that helps you create, edit, and test prompts for your AI models. It provides a user-friendly interface for crafting prompts and allows you to:

- Create, edit, and test your prompts 
- Create AI-generated prompts
- Generate structured output for your app using a predefined schema
- Generation code for prompt interactions based on the query and model in your workspace

> [!NOTE]
> Additional documentation and tutorials for the AI Toolkit for VS Code are available in the VS Code documentation: [AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/intelligentapps/overview). You'll find guidance on Playground, working with AI models, fine-tuning local and cloud-based models, and more.

In this article, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Download, load, and work with a local Phi 3.5 Mini CPU-based small language model (SLM)
> - Create, edit, and test prompts using the local model
> - Create structured output using a predefined schema
> - Generate Python code to run the model with the provided prompts

## Prerequisites

- **VS Code** must be installed. For more information, see [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Getting started with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics).

When utilizing AI features, we recommend that you review: [Developing Responsible Generative AI Applications and Features on Windows](../rai.md).

## Install

See [Get started with AI Toolkit](toolkit-getting-started.md#install) for AI Toolkit installation instructions.

## Select the local model

In this section, you'll learn how to load the Phi 3.5 Mini CPU-based SLM model. The AI Toolkit for VS Code supports local models, which are models that run on your local machine, and cloud-based models, which are hosted in the cloud.

1. Open the **AI Toolkit** view in VS Code by selecting the **AI Toolkit** icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
1. In the **AI Toolkit** view, select the **Prompt Builder** item in the Tools section of the left pane.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/ai-toolkit-prompt-builder-tools.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the AI Toolkit's Tools pane":::

1. In the **Prompt Builder** view, select the **Browse models** button to open the **Model Catalog**.
1. Search for **Phi 3.5** in the **Model Catalog**. The **Phi 3.5 Mini (CPU - Small, Fast, Accurate)** model should appear in the list in the **ONNX Models** section.
1. Select the **Add** button to add the model to your workspace. The model will be downloaded and added to the **My Models** section of the left pane.
1. After the model has finished downloading, return to the **Prompt Builder** view.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/ai-toolkit-prompt-builder.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the AI Toolkit Prompt Builder window":::

1. Enter the following prompt in the **System prompt** text box:

   ```text
   You are a professor of marine biology at a respected university. Answer the following questions as best you can.
   ```

1. Enter the following prompt in the **User prompt** text box:

   ```text
   Please provide a concise list of 10 types of marine mammals that live in the Pacific Ocean.
   ```

1. Select the **Run** button to run the model with the provided prompts.
1. The model will generate a response based on the provided prompts. The response will be displayed in the **Response** text box.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/ai-toolkit-prompt-builder-result.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the AI Toolkit Prompt Builder window with the results of a query about marine mammals displayed":::

1. If you want to refine the results, you have a few options:
   - Edit the **System prompt** or **User prompt** and run query the model again.
   - Select **Add prompt** to add a new prompt to the **User prompt** text box. This will allow you to create a more complex query with multiple prompts.
   - Select **Use Response as Assistant Prompt** to use as context to help guide the model's behavior.
   - Repeat any combination of the above steps until you get the desired results.
1. Select the **View Code** button to generate Python code that uses the SDK to run the model with the provided prompts. The generated code will be displayed in a new editor tab. The code will look similar to the following:

   ```python
    """Run this model in Python
    
    > pip install openai
    """
    from openai import OpenAI
    
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url = "http://localhost:5272/v1/",
        api_key = "unused", # required for the API but not used
    )
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a professor of marine biology at a university",
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "Please provide a concise list of 10 types of marine mammals that live in the Pacific Ocean.",
                    },
                ],
            },
        ],
        model = "Phi-3.5-mini-cpu-int4-awq-block-128-acc-level-4-onnx",
        max_tokens = 256,
        frequency_penalty = 1,
    )
    
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
   ```

1. If you want to run the generated code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:
1. You can run the generated code in your Python environment. For more information on installing and getting started with Python on Windows, see [Get started using Python on Windows for beginners](/windows/python/beginners).

The Prompt Builder is a powerful tool for crafting and refining prompts for your AI models. You can use it to quickly iterate on your prompts and test different variations to find the best results.
