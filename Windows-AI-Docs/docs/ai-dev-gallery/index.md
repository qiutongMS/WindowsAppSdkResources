## Responsible AI

It is of utmost importance to adopt responsible AI practices when integrating AI into your app. The AI Dev Gallery enables users to access a variety of AI models from sources such as Hugging Face, but we cannot guarantee that these models comply with [Microsoft's Responsible AI standards](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).

Users of the AI Dev Gallery are strongly encouraged to take personal accountability for adopting Responsible AI principles, comprehend the limitations and ethical implications of the models, and ensure adherence to applicable licenses when integrating models into your own app.
